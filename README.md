bus
===

A simple bus routing web app using the [sasabus.org](sasabus.org) API.

Works for all SASA bus connections in South Tyrol (i.e. city buses in the areas around Merano and Bolzano). This app is a cleaner, simpler alternative to the routing component of the [official SASA web app](html5.sasabus.org).

##Current Status
**Everything is under heavy development and subject to change.**

The search part of the app is mostly working, but the part that displays the results from the API is not fully implemented yet. Everything else is still in planning.
