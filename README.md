bus
===

A simple bus routing web app using the [sasabus.org](sasabus.org) API.

Works for all SASA bus connections in South Tyrol (i.e. city buses in the areas around Merano and Bolzano). This app is an cleaner, simpler alternative to the routing component of the [official SASA web app](html5.sasabus.org).

##Current Status
**Everything is under heavy development and subject to change.**

The search part of the app is mostly working, but the part that displays the results from the API is not fully implemented yet. Everything else is still in planning.
