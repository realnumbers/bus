bus
===

A simple bus routing web app using the [sasabus.org](http://sasabus.org) API.

Works for all SASA bus connections in South Tyrol (i.e. city buses in the areas around Merano and Bolzano). This app is a cleaner, simpler alternative to the routing component of the [official SASA web app](http://html5.sasabus.org).

##Current Status
**Everything is under heavy development and subject to change.**

Most of the app's functionality is implemented, but there are still some bugs and things missing.
